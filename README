Qcontrol
========

Qcontrol is a daemon and command line tool which controls the various
peripherals that are present on many embedded NAS devices. It supports any
peripheral which is driven by either serial port of GPIO, including
lights, fans, LCDs and watchdogs. Although it primarily supports QNAP TS
devices it is designed to be modular and adding support for other devices
should be easy.

Supported devices:
 - QNAP TS-109, TS-109 II, TS-209 and TS-209 II (ts209)
 - QNAP TS-409 and TS-409U (ts409)
 - QNAP TS-11x, TS-12x, HS-210, TS-21x and TS-22x (ts219)
 - QNAP TS-41x and TS-42x (ts41x)
 - Synology Diskstation and Rackstation (synology)
